The HTML 'Application Manager' application is not a fully functional
'Applications Store'. It is an HTML front-end that uses a REST API to
manage applications hosted by a 'Package Server'. The 'Package Server'
provides a list of applications available including some predefined
application metadata such as version, description, screenshots, etc.
There is no qualification or verification done on these applications and
such 'Package Server' is not a service provided in any means and is not
meant to be used in any kind of production environment.
